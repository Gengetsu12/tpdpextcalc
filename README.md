Honko Damage Calculator (Fork)
=======================

Damage Calculator for Touhou Puppet Dance Performance - Shard of Dreams.
(original game TBA whenever I feel like doing it)

This is NOT the official repository for the Pokemon Showdown damage calculator.
However, it uses said calculator as a base. As a result, it has essentially the same features.
You may find the original here: https://github.com/Zarel/honko-damagecalc

Instructions
------------

Double-click `index.html`.
